# BellApp

### About This Project

This project was developed as part of the "Programmazione Mobile" course at the University of Genoa. It was further expanded and refined as part of the final thesis for the Bachelor's degree in "Ingegneria Informatica". The thesis aimed to explore mobile app development and Firebase integration to create a modern and efficient bell event management system.

Here you have the abstract of our thesis:

> The idea for this thesis stems from the observation of the bell-ringing sector, which is not fully aligned with modern technologies. 
Through an analysis of both the Italian and international markets, and with the collaboration of a leading company in the field, we identified a need for innovation to improve the management of bell systems.
Our project offers an advanced and modern alternative for scheduling and automatically executing events and melodies. Through an Android application and a hardware circuit connected to a centralized database, the system provides intuitive and flexible control of the bell systems. The circuit, built with an STM32 Nucleo board and an ESP32 module, uses buzzers to simulate the sound of bells. Users can schedule events through a calendar and create custom melodies, which the system will play at the specified time and date.
This project offers a concrete solution to the modernization needs of the sector, projecting it into the future while maintaining respect for and preserving the bell-ringing tradition.
